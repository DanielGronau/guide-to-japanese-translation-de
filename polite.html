<h2 id="part1">Not being rude in Japan</h2>
The Japanese we have learned so far is all well and good if you're 5-years old.  Unfortunately, adults are expected to use a politer version of the
language (called <span title="ていねいご - polite language" class="popup">丁寧語</span>) when addressing certain people.  People you will probably use <span title="ていねいご - polite language" class="popup">丁寧語</span> with are: 1) people of higher social rank, and 2) people
you are not familiar with.  Deciding when to use which language is pretty much a matter of 'feel'.  However, it is a good idea to stick with one form
for each person.
<p>Later (probably much later), we will learn an even politer version of the language called honorific （<span title="そんけいご - honorific language" class="popup">尊敬語</span>） and humble （<span title="けんじょうご - humble language" class="popup">謙譲語</span>） form.  It
will be more useful than you may think because store clerks, receptionists, and such will speak to you in those forms.  But for now, let's concentrate on just
<span title="ていねいご - polite language" class="popup">丁寧語</span>, which is the base for <span title="そんけいご - honorific language" class="popup">尊敬語</span> and <span title="けんじょうご - humble language" class="popup">謙譲語</span>.
</p>

<p>Fortunately, it is not difficult to change casual speech to polite speech.  There may be some slight changes to the vocabulary (for example, "yes"
and "no" become 「<span title="はい - yes" class="popup">はい</span>」 and 「<span title="いいえ - no" class="popup">いいえ</span>」 respectively in polite speech), and very colloquial types of gobi obviously are not used in polite speech.
(Don't worry; we haven't even gone over those yet.)  Essentially, the only main difference between polite and casual speech comes at the
very end of the sentence.  You cannot even tell whether a person is speaking in polite or casual speech until the sentence is finished.
</p>

<h2 id="part2">The stem of verbs</h2>
In order to conjugate all u-verbs and ru-verbs into their respective polite forms, we will first learn about the stem of verbs.  This is often called
the <i>masu-stem</i> in Japanese textbooks but we will call it just the <i>stem</i> because it is used in many more conjugations than just its masu-form. The stem is
really great because it's very easy to produce and is useful in many different types of grammar.

<div class="sumbox">
<span class="summary">Rules for extracting the stem of verbs</span>
<ul>
<li>ru-verbs - Remove the 「る」
<br />例) <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べ<em><strike>る</strike></em></span> → <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べ</span></li>
<li>u-verbs - The last vowel sound changes from an / u /  vowel sound to an / i / vowel sound.
<br />例) <span title="およぐ - to swim" class="popup">泳<em><strike>ぐ</strike></em></span> → <span title="およぐ - to swim" class="popup">泳<em>ぎ</em></span></li>
<li>Exceptions - 「<span title="する - to do" class="popup">する</span>」 becomes 「し」 and 「<span title="くる - to come" class="popup">くる</span>」 becomes 「き」.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The stem when used by itself can be a very
specialized and limited way of creating nouns from verbs.  While the 「の」 particle allows you to talk about verbs as if they were nouns, the stem
actually turns verbs into nouns.  In fact, in very rare cases, the stem is used more often than the verb itself.  For example, the stem of 「<span title="いかる - to get angry" class="popup">怒る</span>」（いかる）
is used more often than the verb itself.  The movie, "Fists of Fury" is translated as 「<span title="いかり - fury" class="popup">怒り</span>の<span title="てっけん - fist" class="popup">鉄拳</span>」 and not 「<span title="おこる - to get angry" class="popup">怒る</span><span title="てっけん - fist" class="popup">鉄拳</span>」.  In fact, 「<span title="おこる - to get angry" class="popup">怒る</span>」 will most likely be read
as 「<span title="おこる - to get angry" class="popup">おこる</span>」, a completely different verb with the same meaning and kanji!  There are a number of specific nouns (such as 「<span title="やすみ - rest, vacation" class="popup">休み</span>」)
that are really verb stems that are used like regular nouns. However, in general we cannot take any verb and make it into a noun.
For example, the following sentence is wrong.
</p>

<p>
（誤）　飲みを<span title="する - to do" class="popup">する</span>。- (This sentence makes sense but no one talks like this)
</p>

<p>However, a useful grammar that works in general for stems of all verbs is using the stem as a target with a motion verb (almost always 「行く」 and
「来る」 in this case).  This grammar means, "to go or to come to do [some verb]".  Here's an example.

</p>
<p>
（１）　<span title="あした - tomorrow" class="popup">明日</span>、<span title="えいが - movie" class="popup">映画</span>を<em><span title="みる - to see" class="popup">見</span>に</em><span title="いく - to go" class="popup">行く</span>。- Tomorrow, go to see movie.
<br />
「<span title="みる - to see" class="popup">見</span>に」 is the stem of 「<span title="みる - to see" class="popup">見る</span>」 combined with the target particle 「に」.
</p>

<p>The motion target particle 「へ」 sounds like you're literally going or coming to something while the 「に」 particle implies that you are going or coming
for the purpose of doing something.
</p>
<p>
（１）　<span title="きのう - yesterday" class="popup">昨日</span>、<span title="ともだち - friend" class="popup">友達</span>が<em><span title="あそぶ - to play" class="popup">遊び</span>へ</em><span title="くる - to come" class="popup">きた</span>。
<br />- Yesterday, friend came to a playing activity. (Sounds a bit strange)
</p>
<p>
（２）　<span title="きのう - yesterday" class="popup">昨日</span>、<span title="ともだち - friend" class="popup">友達</span>が<em><span title="あそぶ - to play" class="popup">遊び</span>に</em><span title="くる - to come" class="popup">きた</span>。
<br />- Yesterday, friend came to play.
</p>

<p>The expression 「<span title="たのしむ - to enjoy" class="popup">楽しみ</span>に<span title="する - to do" class="popup">する</span>」 meaning "to look forward to" is formed from grammar similar to this but is a special case and should be
considered a set expression.</p>

<p>Other verbs are also sometimes attached to the stem to create new verbs.  For example, when 「<span title="だす - to bring out" class="popup">出す</span>」 is attached to
the stem of 「<span title="はしる - to run" class="popup">走る</span>」, which is 「<span title="はしる - to run" class="popup">走り</span>」, you get 「<span title="はしりだす - to break into a run" class="popup">走り出す</span>」 meaning "to break out into a run".
Other examples include 「<span title="きりかえる - to switch" class="popup">切り替える</span>」, which
means "to switch over to something else", and 「<span title="つけくわえる - to add one thing to another" class="popup">付け加える</span>」, which means "to add something by attaching it".  You can see how the separate
meanings of the two verbs are combined to create the new combined verb.  For example, 「<span title="いいだす - to start talking" class="popup">言い出す</span>」 means "to start talking",
combining the meaning, "to speak" and "to bring out".  There are no general rules here, you need to just memorize these combined
verbs as separate verbs in their own right.
</p>

<p>Things that are written in a formal context such as newspaper articles also use the stem as a conjunctive verb.
We will come back to this later in the <a href="formal.html#part4">Formal Expression</a> lesson.
</p>

<h2 id="part3">Using 「～ます」 to make verbs polite</h2>
Of course, the reason I introduced the verb stem is to learn how to conjugated verbs into their polite form... the masu-form!  The masu-form
must always come at the end of a complete sentence and never inside a modifying subordinate clause.  When we learn compound sentences, we will see that
each sub-sentence of the compound sentence can end in masu-form as well.

<p>
To conjugate verbs into the masu-form, you attach different conjugations of 「ます」 to the stem depending on the tense.  Here is a chart.
</p>

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<caption>A conjugation chart with sample stem 「<span title="あそぶ - to play" class="popup">遊び</span>」</caption>

<h3>Examples</h3>
As usual, let's see some examples.
<p>
（１）　<span title="あした - tomorrow" class="popup">明日</span>、<span title="だいがく - college" class="popup">大学</span>に<em><span title="いく - to go" class="popup">行きます</span></em>。
<br />- Tomorrow, go to college.
</p>

<p>
（２）　<span title="せんしゅう - last week" class="popup">先週</span>、ボブに<em><span title="あう - to meet" class="popup">会いました</span></em>よ。
<br />- You know, met Bob last week.
</p>

<p>
（３）　<span title="ばんごはん - dinner" class="popup">晩ご飯</span>を<em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べませんでした</span></em>ね。
<br />- Didn't eat dinner, huh?
</p>

<p>
（４）　<span title="おもしろい - interesting" class="popup">面白くない</span><span title="えいが - movie" class="popup">映画</span>は<em><span title="みる - to see" class="popup">見ません</span></em>。
<br />- About not interesting movies, do not see (them).
</p>

<h2 id="part4">Using 「です」 for everything else</h2>
For any sentence that does not end in a ru-verb or u-verb, the only thing that needs to be done is to add 「です」 or 「でした」.  You can also do this for
substituted nouns (both 「の」 and 「ん」) by just treating them like regular nouns (refer to: <a href="particles3.html#part4">Particle 3</a>).
Another important thing to remember is
that if there is a declarative 「だ」, it must be removed.  In being polite, I guess you can't be so bold as to forwardly declare things the way 「だ」 does.
Just like the masu-form, this must also go at the end of a complete sentence. Here is a chart illustrating the conjugations.

<p />
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">

</table>

</center>

<p>※ Notice in the case of noun/na-adjective <u>only</u>, the past tense becomes 「でした」. A very common mistake
is to do the same for i-adjectives. Remember 「<span title="かわいい - cute" class="popup">かわいい</span><em><strike>でした</strike></em>」 is wrong!</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>As usual, let's see some examples.</p>

<p>
（１）　<span title="こいぬ - puppy" class="popup">子犬</span>は<span title="とても - very" class="popup">とても</span><em><span title="すき - like" class="popup">好き</span>です</em>。
<br />- About puppies, like very much. (The most natural translation is that someone likes puppies very much but
there is not enough context to rule out that the puppies like something very much.)
</p>

<p>
（２）　<span title="きのう - yesterday" class="popup">昨日</span>、<span title="じかん - time" class="popup">時間</span>が<em><span title="ある - to exist (inanimate)" class="popup">なかった</span>んです</em>。
<br />- It was that there was no time yesterday.
</p>

<p>
（３）　<span title="その - that" class="popup">その</span><span title="へや - room" class="popup">部屋</span>は<span title="あまり - not very" class="popup">あまり</span><em><span title="しずか - quiet" class="popup">静かじゃない</span>です</em>。
<br />- That room is not very quiet.
</p>

<p>
（４）　<span title="せんしゅう - last week" class="popup">先週</span>に<span title="みる - to see" class="popup">見た</span><span title="えいが - movie" class="popup">映画</span>は、<span title="とても - very" class="popup">とても</span><em><span title="おもしろい - interesting" class="popup">面白かった</span>です</em>。
<br />- Movie saw last week was very interesting.
</p>

<h3>※ Reality Check</h3>
I have heard on a number of occasions that the negative non-past conjugation as given here is not an "officially" correct conjugation. Instead,
what's considered to be a more "correct" conjugation is to
actually replace the 「ないです」 part with 「<span title="ある - to exist (inanimate)" class="popup">ありません</span>」.  The reasoning is that the polite negative form of the verb
「<span title="ある - to exist (inanimate)" class="popup">ある</span>」 is not 「ないです」 but 「<span title="ある - to exist (inanimate)" class="popup">ありません</span>」.
Therefore,
「<span title="かわいい - cute" class="popup">かわいくない</span>」 actually becomes 「<span title="かわいい - cute" class="popup">かわいくありません</span>」
and 「<span title="しずか - quiet" class="popup">静かじゃない</span>」 becomes 「<span title="しずか - quiet" class="popup">静かじゃありません</span>」.
<p>The reality of today's Japanese is that what's supposed to be the "official" conjugation sounds rather stiff and formal. In normal everyday conversations, the conjugation presented here
will be used almost every time. While you should use the more formal conjugations for written works using the polite form, you'll rarely hear it in actual speech.
In conclusion, I recommend studying and becoming familiar with <u>both</u> types of conjugations.

<br />- You know, that room is not very quiet.
</p>

<h2 id="part5">「です」 is NOT the same as 「だ」</h2>
Many of you who have taken Japanese classes have probably been taught that 「です」 is the polite version of 「だ」. However, I want to point some
several key differences here and the reasons why they are in fact completely different things.
It is impossible to fully explain the reasons why they are fundamentally different without discussing grammar that have yet to be covered so I would like to target this
toward those who have already started learning Japanese and have been incorrectly misinformed that 「だ」 is the casual version of 「です」. For the rest of you
new to this, you can easily skip this part.

<p>I'm sure most of you have learned the expression 「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>」 by now. Now, there are four ways to make a
complete sentence using the state-of-being with 「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>」 to produce a sentence that says, "That is so."
</p>

<h3>Different ways to say, "That is so."</h3>
（１）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>。
<br />（２）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>だ。
<br />（３）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>です。
<br />（４）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>でございます。

<p>The first 「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>」 is the implied state of being and
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>だ」 is the declarative.  As I've stated before, the non-assuming soft spoken
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>」 is often used by females while the more confident
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>だ」 is often used by males.
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>です」 is the polite version of
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>」, created by attaching 「です」 to the noun.
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>です」 is <b>not</b> the polite version of
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>だ」 where the 「だ」 is replaced by 「です」 and I'll explain why.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps we wanted to make that sentence into a question instead to ask, "Is that so?" There are several ways to do this but some possibilities are given in the following.
(This grammar is covered in a <a href="question.html">later section</a>.)
</p>
<h3>Different ways to ask, "Is that so?"</h3>
（１）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>？
<br />（２）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>か？
<br />（３）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>ですか？

<p>As I've explained before, the 「だ」 is used to declare what one believes to be a fact. Therefore,
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>だか？」 is not a valid way to ask a question because it is declaring a fact and asking a question
at the same time. But the fact that 「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>ですか」 is a valid question shows that 「です」 and 「だ」 are
essentially different. 「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>です」, in showing respect and humbleness, is not as assertive and is
merely the polite version of 「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>」.
</p>

<p>Besides the difference in nuance between 「だ」 and 「です」, another key difference is that 「だ」 is used in many different types of grammar to delineate a
subordinate clause. 「です」, on the other hand, is only used at the end of a sentence to designate a polite state-of-being. For instance, consider the two following
sentences. (This grammar is covered in a <a href="quotation.html">later section</a>.)
</p>

<p>
（正）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span><em>だ</em>と<span title="おもう - to think" class="popup">思います</span> - I think that is so.
<br />（誤）　<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span><em><strike>です</strike></em>と<span title="おもう - to think" class="popup">思います</span> - (Incorrect sentence)
</p>

<p>
「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span><em>だ</em>と<span title="おもう - to think" class="popup">思います</span>」 is valid
while 「<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span><em>です</em>と<span title="おもう - to think" class="popup">思います</span>」 is not
because 「です」 can only go at the end of the sentence. 「です」 can only be in a subordinate clause when it is a direct quote of what someone said such as the following.
</p>

<p>（１）　「はい、<span title="そう - that's so, that's right" class="popup">そう</span>です」と<span title="こたえる - to answer" class="popup">答えた</span>。
</p>

In conclusion, replacing 「です」 with 「だ」, thinking one is the polite equivalent of the other or vice-versa will potentially result in grammatically incorrect sentences.
It is best to think of them as totally separate things (because they are).
